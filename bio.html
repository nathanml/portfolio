							<h1 class="major">About Me</h1>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="" /></span><p>Nathan Maher Levy is a backend-focused software engineer with over five years of experience designing and delivering scalable, cloud-native solutions. Specializing in distributed systems, APIs, and object-oriented design, Nathan has led the development of enterprise services across regulated industries, with a strong emphasis on reliability, security, and performance.</p>
							<p>Currently a tech lead at Citizens Financial Group, Nathan heads a development pod responsible for cloud-based microservices that power core banking features—ranging from client screening and account origination to electronic signature capture and rapid loan approval workflows. His leadership has helped launch production-ready services that support mission-critical financial operations, earning industry recognition for innovation and technical excellence.</p>
							<p>Nathan’s backend toolkit includes Java, Python, C++, and C#, with hands-on experience across major frameworks such as Spring, Django, Flask, Express, ASP.NET, and Angular. He’s well-versed in cloud platforms (AWS and Google Cloud), containerization and orchestration (Docker, Terraform, Jenkins), and distributed messaging systems like Kafka. He also brings expertise in relational and nonrelational databases, as well as operational experience in Unix/Linux environments.</p>
							<p>In addition to his professional work, Nathan is pursuing a master’s degree in computer science at Tufts University, where he studies systems design, security, and applied machine learning. He holds a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Boston University with a minor in piano performance.</p>
							<p>Nathan is also active outside the office: building an online free-store to promote community sustainability, developing a machine learning model to predict Academy Award outcomes, and exploring knowledge distillation techniques for large language models as a step toward reducing their environmental footprint. A committed mentor and lifelong learner, he’s driven by a passion for both technological excellence and ethical innovation.</p>
							<p>When not writing code, Nathan enjoys hiking, reading, watching films, volunteering, and spending time with his two cats, Evie and Casper.</p>
